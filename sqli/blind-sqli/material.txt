Blind SQL injection

In this section, we'll describe what blind SQL injection is, explain various techniques for finding and exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
What is blind SQL injection?

Blind SQL injection arises when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the details of any database errors.

With blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, many techniques such as UNION attacks, are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses. It is still possible to exploit blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.
