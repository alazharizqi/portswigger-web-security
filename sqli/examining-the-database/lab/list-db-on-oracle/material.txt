Equivalent to information schema on Oracle

On Oracle, you can obtain the same information with slightly different queries.

You can list tables by querying all_tables:
SELECT * FROM all_tables

And you can list columns by querying all_tab_columns:
SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS'
